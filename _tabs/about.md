Hi... I’m Daniel, and I’m thrilled to welcome you to my corner of the internet.If you’re here, you probably share a passion for the world of software development and computer science

I’m a software developer with interest in compilers, operating system and computer networks and algorithm design.
I mostly work with C, C++, python, javascript and Go.

This blog is my platform to share my thoughts, insights, and things I’ve learnt or found interesting. Let’s explore, learn, and grow together.

You can find some of my projects on [github](https://github.com/danieldamilare) and also check out my *resume*.

> If you have any questions, ideas, or topics you’d like [me](mailto:danieldamilare20@gmail.com) to cover, don’t hesitate to reach out.
