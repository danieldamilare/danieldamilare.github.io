Hi, I’m Daniel.

This site is a personal space for writing, reflection, and public accountability.  
I use it primarily to document my thinking, plans, and progress over time, especially as the year unfolds.

I’m a software engineer with a strong interest in backend and systems programming, including compilers, networking, and operating systems. I enjoy building software close to the system and exploring how things work under the hood.

Some of my work involves low-level languages and tooling, and I occasionally write about things I’ve learned, ideas I’m exploring, or problems I find interesting.

Outside of programming, I enjoy music and spend time learning instruments when I can.

This site is not meant to be exhaustive or polished; it’s a living log, written primarily for clarity and consistency rather than an audience.

You can find selected projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/danieldamilare).  
For anything else, feel free to reach out by [email](mailto:danieldamilare20@gmail.com).
