<h2 id="first-post">First Post</h2>
<p>This is the first post on my blog. I created this blog to improve my writing skills and also to share more of my learning journey. This blog will be mostly about programming. As written in my <a href="/about">About Me</a> page. I’m passionate about low-level programming and I mostly code in C and C++  and also with python. I will be sharing my learning journey on this blog.
Welcome to my New blog. Let’s do this together.</p>
