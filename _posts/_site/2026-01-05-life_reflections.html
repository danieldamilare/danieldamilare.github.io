<p>2026 began 7 days ago, and I haven’t done anything signifcant in direction of progress. Last year was a tumultous year for me. It is one of the best year in terms of growth, but I also faced tons of challenges which made me stumble a lot. I was able to learn a lot and build many interesting project including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A bnf grammar validator validating the syntax, productiveness and reachability.</li>
  <li>A networked tictactoe client/server</li>
  <li>A bf compiler that generates raw elf binary written in x86 assembly</li>
  <li>A json parser that does pretty printing
Also I took on software project that deals with backend and frotnend and requires significant architectural design. I designed an encounter monitoring site that does automatic data analysis and others. This is another word for a form and data aggregration. The admin can view various chart, and generates report. 
I also began Competitive programming as a sport last year.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>PMO</strong>: I have been struggling with PMO for more than 6 years now, it now seems like an automatic activity I can’t combat but now I don’t want to fight it, but instead face develping my life and lacking attributres.</p>

<p><strong>Financial improvement</strong>: In addition to technical achievement, my finances also improved last year, even though I ended the year in debt. I was able to spend money to buy things I needed like an earbud, new clothes and more. This year I planned to get out of debt and start saving.</p>

<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<p>On programming, I want to develop more aggressive this year. I’m focusing on concurrency, system programming, and backend engineering.  I divide the aspect of my development into three  areas: reading of technical books, competitive programming, system programming.</p>

<h3 id="reading-of-technical-books">Reading of Technical Books</h3>
<p>I plan to read the following books this year</p>
<ul>
  <li>The little book of Semaphore</li>
  <li>Butenhoff Programming with Posix threads</li>
  <li>Computer System: A programmer’s perspective</li>
  <li>Operating System: Three easy pieces</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="competitive-programming">Competitive Programming</h3>
<p>I began competitive programming last year, as a way to pass interview but I later enjoyed doing them, it absolutely improve my programing skill. I solved in total last year: 275 leetcode problems, 150 codeforces, 80 atcoder problems, 40 Usaco old training site problem, and also read Daniel Zagaro Algorithmic thinking. This year, I’m planning to drop leetcode for a while, and focus on the real competitive programming site (Codeforce and Atcoder). My goal this year is to reach an expert rank on codeforce. I am to be consistent throughout the year. I know the year has started, and I haven’t done anything, but planning. I aim to use target practice. I found a site with problem based curriculum for CP. I will start by targeting my weak areas like Number theory and combinatorics, then greedy and math algorithms.</p>

<h2 id="system-programming">System Programming</h2>
<p>I registered for Btrust Bitcoin Open Source Software Programming, and which be starting from January 12, also I want to focus on developing more system programming skills, and building full projects. In a way, both the technical books I planned to read complement my system programming goals.</p>

<h2 id="personal-development">Personal Development</h2>
<p>Last year was a year I focused a lot on technical goals. This year I want to make my focus more balanced, by focusing on not only on upskilling, but also on personal development. My personal development goal would encompass: Defeating Depression/Building Self esteem, Improving my Reading habits, Self Care (Skin Care and Eating Well, Dopamine Regulation, Sleep).</p>

<h3 id="defeating-depression-building-self-esteem">Defeating Depression/ Building Self Esteem</h3>
<p>Depression is a silent killer, accounting for most mental health challenge. I haven’t been formally diagnose to be depressed, but I don’t need to be diagnose to know I’m depressed. I have almost all the characteristics of depression: Disqualifying the positive, low self esteem, motivation depletion. This h as been how I’ve been living my life for about 5 years now, but this year has to be different. While I don’t have access to mental health resources available to people in other countries, and can’t see a therapist. I planned to use David Burn’s Feeling Good book as a tool, and practicalize it. I will also study various books on ADHD, Introversion and self confidence.</p>

<h3 id="reading-habits">Reading Habits</h3>
<p>Another Challenge I want to take on this year is reading more. I would start with novels as they have easier entry points, I don’t really have a definite goal for this, and don’t know how I would define reading more.</p>

<h3 id="skin-care-and-eating-well">Skin Care and Eating Well</h3>
<p>As part of way to build self esteem. I want to make this year, a year of self care. I want to eat well. One of the biggest challenges I’ve been facing is eating well. I have a lazy cooking habit, and find it hard to cook at all. So I want to make intentional habit to change that this year. I planned to follow this cooking schedule:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cook stew twice a week (Sunday and Wednesday)</li>
  <li>Eat consistently - can’t skip meals</li>
  <li>Eat at least 2 eggs daily</li>
  <li>2 Fish/per week (use for making the soup/stew)</li>
  <li>Eat 500 Naira worth of fruit daily (1 slice of watermelon, 2 oranges, few carrots) consistently</li>
  <li>Eat breakfast in the morning, take lunch to work. (morning breakfast can include: Oats, noodles, or bread and tea).
Another part of self care I must also focus on is sleeping well. I will be tracking my sleep, and making sure I’m getting at least 7 hours of sleep daily. One of the biggest obstacle to my sleep is my phone, and PMO every night. So i will start a shutdown protocol with an app, that lock off my phone once it is 10pm, and won’t unlock it until it is 5am.</li>
</ul>

<p>I created this blog as a public accountability platform, where I share daily struggle, learning, and development throughout the year.</p>
