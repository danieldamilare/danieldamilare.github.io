<p>I’ve always been fascinated by how programming languages are created. This concept used to feel like magic to me when I was only programming in Python and JavaScript. Last year, I decided to learn C and was introduced to some low-level programming concepts. I experienced many “aha!” moments on concepts I failed to understand in Python. So, I decided to study compiler design. I undertook an initial exploration through Austin Henley’s <a href="https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler3.html">Let’s Make a Teeny Tiny Compiler</a> series,  where I successfully wrote a <a href="https://github.com/danieldamilare/simple_compiler">simple compiler</a> in C that compiles a dialect of BASIC into C. Additionally, I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/danieldamilare/math_evaluator">simple math expression evaluator</a>.</p>

<p>Building on my progress, my next endeavour in compiler writing was writing a <strong>CDECL</strong> translator, which takes an English statement defining a C  declaration and generates the equivalent C code. For instance, a statement like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x is a pointer to a struct temp</code>  would generate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">struct temp * x</code>. Although I was successful in writing the parser, I faced challenges in generating the C code which further motivated me to formally study compiler design.</p>

<p>To comprehensively study compiler design, I will be using <a href="https://holub.com/goodies/compiler/compilerDesignInC.pdf">Compiler Design in C by Allen Holub</a> (the book is old, but I love its content) and the renowned “Dragon Book”. These should keep me busy for several months. I will also be writing blog posts documenting my learning journey.</p>

<p>If you have better resources for learning compilers, feel free to share them in the comments.</p>
